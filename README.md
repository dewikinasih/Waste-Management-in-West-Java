There are only 15 city in Jawa Barat that tracked in this dataset. With that 15 data we can get insightful information, those are :
Food waste makes up the largest single category of waste reaching landfills in Jawa Barat
Three cities that produced the most waste are Bekasi, Bandung, and Depok
Although Bekasi is the first waste producer, only 0,3% of waste is being recycled
